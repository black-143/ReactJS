They give you a html button and when a user clicks a button

it continually adds a progress bar onto the page

The progress bar would then have to load in a given amount of time (think 3-5 sec)

You also have to throttle how many progress bars can be running at once.

For example, if the limit is 3 progress bars, and the user clicks on the
button 4 times, the fourth progress bar only starts after the very first
one finishes. You need proper scoping on this.
